# overspeed

This project is a desktop application designed to process raw CSV data from the St John vehicle telematics systems. It identifies overspeed events based on user parameters, grouping consecutive occurrences into distinct blocks to enable smooth user-readability. The application then generates a formatted Excel report that highlights these event blocks and identifies any extreme overspeed incidents, providing a clear summary for the St John fleet management to take action.
